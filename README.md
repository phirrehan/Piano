# Piano(SFML)

This is a simple Piano made using C++ with SFML library. It is cross-platform and will work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Here is a sample video of the piano on linux:

# Usage Guide

## Download Source Code

Download the source code from the github repository or using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/phirrehan/Piano.git
cd Piano
```

## Compile

Open terminal/powershell and run the following command in root of project:

>Note: Ensure you have the C++ compiler and cmake in PATH environment variable.

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Run Binary

After successful compilation, execute the `main` binary in `build/bin/main` directory. Using command line, this can be done with `./build/bin/main` or `.\build\bin\main` for Linux/MacOS and Windows respectively. 

# Sound

The piano uses a singular sound (placed in `assets/Sounds`) for producing the sound of different notes. By default, this sound is set to `Acoustic.mp3`. It can be easily changed by editing `buffer`, a global variable in `src/main.cpp`.

## Brief Music Theory

This piano uses Equal Temperament as its tuning system. The pitch of adjacent notes have common ratio of $\sqrt[12]{2}$. The C2 Note of this piano is the original sound. All the other sounds have been derived from that sound by multiplying/dividing the pitch by $\sqrt[12]{2}$.

# Controls

The sharp notes (with # in front of them) are the black keys, while the rest are the white keys.
